# diabetic-retinopathy-detection
This project is to use the Kaggle dataset and implement deep learning algorithms to predict Diabetic Retinopathy in eye vessel images.

This model was trained on the APTOS 2019 dataset to help automatically screen images for Diabetic Retinopathy, the #1 cause of blindness in adults.

Currently, the model achieves 64.33% accuracy on an unseen portion of the data, but can be improved in the future by iterating on the model and by adding data augmentation techniques.
